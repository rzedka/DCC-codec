Optron: 6N137 in DIP-8


The DDC RX pin : PIND2 configured as external interrupt

Two control GPIO pins: 
PIND3 | PIND4 
   0  |   0    Station   dcc_decoder_mode == 0
   0  |   1    Station   dcc_decoder_mode == 0 (returns "Undefined mode" in console)
   1  |   0    Station   dcc_decoder_mode == 0 (returns "Undefined mode" in console)  
   1  |   1    Entrance  dcc_decoder_mode == 1


There is a possibility to have four different decoder configurations!! 

============================================================
============================================================

Function DCC_Address_Recogniton() is designed in the following way:


1) The Station configuration (dcc_decoder_mode == 0):

  Addr    railway light
  
  104     4-light (ID 0x01) - Green, White, Yellow, Red
  108     4-light (ID 0x01) - Green, White, Yellow, Red
  112     4-light (ID 0x01) - Green, White, Yellow, Red
  116     4-light (ID 0x01) - Green, White, Yellow, Red
  
  160     4-light (ID 0x02)
  224     4-light (ID 0x02)
  
  120     3-light (ID 0x03)
  124	  3-light (ID 0x03)
  
  164     2-light (ID 0x04)
  
  
2) The Entrance configuration (dcc_decoder_mode == 1):

  Addr    railway light

  160     2-light (ID 0x11)
  
  164     2-light (ID 0x12)
  
  81     5-light (ID 0x15)
  100     5-light (ID 0x15)
  
 ============================================================
 ============================================================
 The function DCC_LED_Driver() then uses the light ID and received data to control the LEDs in the addressed railway light.

NOTE: Every incoming command to a certain Railway light resets the previous action, e.g. if the previous action was green blinking, and dat nibbele
